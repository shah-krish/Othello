RandomVSRandom Report

1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy? 
Second player seems to have an advantage for a random strategy. In all our outputs, the second player seemed to have slightly more wins than the first player. 

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:

4) H0 is There is not much difference between the win rates of Player 1 and Player 2 so the first or second player has no advantage when both use a random strategy.

5) Ha is  There is significant difference between the win rates of Player 1 and Player 2 so either the first or second player has some advantage when both use a random strategy.


6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results do not support H0, so they support Ha

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0
I have created ZTestCalculator class to argue against H0.
